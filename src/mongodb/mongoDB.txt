MongoDB

-No-Sql document based DB
-Strong support for aggregation pipes
-Works on BSON format
-Best for Nodejs apps

COLLECTIONS - eg: "users", "blogs"

- Inside a collection we can have a no of documnents

Start mongodb in cmd line
- mongosh
- show dbs
- use <db_name>
- show collections
- db.users.find({}) - Gives array of documnents
- db.users.insert({}) 

We have Schema to define the structure. 
We use this Schema we make a Model, and using Model we can do CRUD operations
